update transaction process breakdown:
    1. a GET request to update-transaction url is sent, along with transaction pk (from template), it will use the pk to get the item instance from database
    2. a partial containg a form and that specific transaction item is returned, form is pre-populated with transaction data
    3. upon submitting this form, a POST request is sent to the same url (update-transaction) along with new data and pk of that transaction
    4. same view will check, if request type is POST, it will receive a form with updated data
    5. if form is valid, view will update the transaction item using the same instance (without creating new instance, this is important)
    6. if update was successful, a new partial with just a message will be returned (successful update message)
    7. if not, the update transaction form partial will be returned, this time along with form errors
